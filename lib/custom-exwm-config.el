;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains my settings for EXWM.  Notable features:
;;   - Functions `exwm-fullscreen-or-reset' and `exwm-quit'
;;   - Keybindings for `eshell' and `helm-mini'
;;   - A bunch of prefix keys for use with Edwina
;;   - All the annoying bars are disabled.

;;; Code:

(require 'exwm)
(require 'exwm-xim)

(defun custom-exwm-window-setup ()
  "Make some extra room in the frame.

This disables `menu-bar-mode', `tool-bar-mode', and
`scroll-bar-mode'"
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1))

;;; Toggle fullscreen
(defvar exwm-fullscreen--old-window nil
  "The last window to be focused before
`exwm-fullscreen-or-reset' was called.")

(defun exwm-fullscreen-or-reset ()
  "Toggle EXWM fullscreen layout.  Use either the current exwm
window or the first exwm window found."
